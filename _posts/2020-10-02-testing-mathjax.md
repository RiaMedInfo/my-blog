<h2><em>Learning how to live with acne: </em></h2>
<h2><em>What is acne, how to deal with it and lifestyle improvement! </em></h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Acne</em> </strong>is a condition that many people struggle with and it has always been an interesting topic to write about as it is relatable to most of us. Having myself suffered with acne for almost one year now, I can understand how unpleasant and overwhelming someone&rsquo;s life can get when having to deal with acne. It can affect the person&rsquo;s self-esteem, confidence, and wellbeing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, someone could also argue that acne is a condition that the person will have to learn how to live with and oftentimes, it can lead to the adoption of a better lifestyle such as healthier diet and better self-care habits.</p>
<p>Talking numbers, acne is quite common in teenagers and young adults and 95% of people aged from 11 to 30 years get affected by acne to a different extent (1). Most of the people will also need to deal with acne for many years until the symptoms start subsiding and eventually improve (1). Therefore, why not stop thinking of acne as an unwelcome guest and start trying to understand it, explore all treatment options and improve our lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>Understanding acne&hellip;what is acne? </strong></p>
<p>Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin and it can result from different factors such as androgen-induced sebum overproduction, altered keratinisation, inflammation due to bacterial colonisation of hair follicles by the Propionibacterium acnes, a syndrome called polycystic ovary syndrome and the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Acne can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe and it can result in painful lesions, scarring and eventually low confidence and subsequent conditions such as depression, social isolation, and suicidal ideation (2). Moreover, it usually appears in adolescence, but it can also occur during adulthood. Acne can develop on several parts of the body such as face, back, chest and usually involves one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blackheads: small, black, or yellowish bumps on the skin (open plugged pores). (3)</li>
<li>Whiteheads: closed plugged pores.</li>
<li>Papules: small, red bumps.</li>
<li>Pustules: they look like papules, but they also have a white tip in the centre.</li>
<li>Nodules: large hard lumps that develop beneath the surface of the skin.</li>
<li>Cysts: they are the most severe form of acne, they are large lumps filed with pus and they can cause permanent scarring.</li>
</ul>
<p>What treatment options are available:</p>
<p>The type of acne treatment that someone will receive really depends on the severity of the condition, the individual&rsquo;s preference, and the patient&rsquo;s tolerability. The mild/ moderate acne is normally treated with a combination of topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotic creams, topical retinoids, azelaic acid.&nbsp; All the systemic therapies are usually reserved for moderate to severe acne (oral contraceptives, oral antibiotics, oral isotretinoin) (2,3). The following table displays the most common acne therapies based on the severity of the individual&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>Based on the NHS guidelines (4)</p>
<p>Moreover, there are several treatments that do not involve administration of medicines, and these can be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comedone extractor- a sharp instrument used to remove blackheads and whiteheads,</li>
<li>Peeling: using chemicals to peel off the skin.</li>
<li>Photodynamic therapy- using light to improve acne symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>A little bit more on the photodynamic therapy&hellip;.</p>
<p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a quite new treatment for acne and it involves the use of a photosensitizer in combination with a light source and oxygen. The most common photosensitizers used were 5-aminolevulinic acid and methyl aminolevulinate, and both showed similar response. Red light was the most frequently used light source, followed by intense pulsed light, and showed comparable results. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions both responded to treatment, with inflammatory lesions showing greater clearance in most studies. Adverse events associated with PDT for acne were mild and included pain on illumination and post-procedural erythema and edema (6).

<p><strong>Improving diet to treat acne: myth or true? </strong></p>
<p>https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-diet-really-matter-when-it-comes-to-adult-acne-2020081920726</p>
<p>It is rather often stated that diet can improve acne or even treat acne. The connection between acne and diet is not clear and as stated in the NHS guidelines: There is no evidence that diet can play a role in acne (1).&nbsp; There are several nutrients such Vitamin A and Vitamin D (they control metabolism, activation, inactivation, and elimination of specialized skin cell) as well as several minerals such as zinc and iron (anti-inflammatory properties) that play a significant role in the bodily function.</p>
<p>Therefore, although clinical studies have not been conducted, someone would expect that a diet rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory nutrients could affect acne in a good way.</p>
<p>There have been studies that suggest acne does not get affected by diet and other studies that support the existence of a link between those two. An example is the possible influence of the consumption of dietary products in acne as they affect the production of hormones and growth factors in sebaceous gland as well as the production of sebum.</p>
<p>Another dietary factor is the glycaemic index of our diet. According to one study (Smith et al) consumption of food with high glycemic index can lead to overproduction of insulin (which can lead to over proliferation of sebocytes and sebum production), raise androgen concentration and lower SHBG levels (Sex hormone-binding globulin, has been correlated with lowering acne severity). One last nutrient that might play an important role in acne is fatty acids, there have been epidemiological studies that support that the ratio of omega6/ omega 3 fatty acids can affect inflammatory acne (more omega 3 can reduce inflammatory factors).</p>
<p><em>Conclusively,</em> acne is a quite common condition that will affect most young people and it can persist for many years. Therefore, being aware of the most well-established treatment options is one of the most important steps someone should take. Being informed on acne and the different levels of severity could be critical so that someone will seek medical help at the right time and avoid scarring and all the emotional burden that goes hand in hand with acne.</p>
<p>In this article, diet was also mentioned as one of the possible ways to improve acne symptoms although it has not been scientifically that it does so. However, it is worth researching on the different nutrients and how they can affect the bodily function. At the end of the day, getting a healthier diet might not necessarily lead to treating acne but could be beneficial to someone&rsquo;s health and it can be a great boost to your confidence.</p>
