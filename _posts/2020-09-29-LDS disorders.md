There are several reasons for the sudden increase in the interest of the pharmaceutical companies in these conditions such as financial benefits given to them by governments. Therefore, it is interesting to better understand these conditions starting with answering to the question &hellip;</p>

Hence, the disruption of certain metabolic pathways leads to the accumulation of many toxic products in the human cells, and more specifically in the lysosomes, leading to the creation of large intracellular vacuoles (2, 6). These conditions are around 51 in total and although the metabolic pathway that each one of them involves might differ, they do have certain similarities such as their progressive nature. All LSDs can lead to the deterioration of the person&rsquo;s condition and eventually cause severe symptoms and early death (8).</p>

The first LSD disease to be described iwas Gaucher disease in 1882 followed by Fabry disease in 1898 (9). Significant role in the unraveling of the mechanism of LSDs played the discovery of the lysosome by de Duve and colleagues in the late 1950s and 1960s (4, 5).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lysosomes exist in all cell types and they are membrane bound organelles. They contain around 25 lysosomal membrane proteins and 50 known hydrolytic enzymes (glycosidase, lipase, nuclease, phosphatase, protease, sulfatase). The lysosomal enzymes are produced (synthesised) in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) after which they receive some posttranslational modifications in order to reach the lysosome. Moreover, the Lysosomal membrane proteins are classified into different groups of small metabolite exporter proteins including cystinosin, sialin, and cobalamin transporters. (1)</p>

<p>Most common Lysosomal Storage Disorders:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As mentioned before, the genetically described lysosomal storage disorders are around 51 in total. But, as there might be several mutations of the same gene, the disorders are also categorised into infantile and adult types (1). The most common Lysosomal Storage conditions are described below:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} --></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mucopolysaccharidosis: The mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans are sugar molecules that can be found in the connective tissue and other tissues such as skin, cartilage, cornea, liver, spleen, vascular tissue. The most common conditions are MPS I (Hurler or Scheie syndrome) and MPS II (Hunter syndrome).&nbsp;Both syndromes have a quite wide range of symptoms. The severe form of the condition involves developmental delay, short stature, recurrent ear and respiratory infections, hepatosplenomegaly, and coarsening of facial features.&nbsp;</li>

<p><span>2.Pompe disease is the disorder of glycogenolysis and thus, there is accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes. The enlarged lysosomes cause damage in the cardiac and skeletal muscles. The disease has two different presentations: the early onset Pompe disease (Infantile Onset Pompe Disease) and the late onset Pompe disease (LOPD).</span></p>
<p><span>3.Gaucher disease is the most common LSD disorder. The prevalence of the disorder is 1/ 40000. The disease is caused by mutations in GBA which leads to the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. The accumulation of the glucosylceramide in the lysosomes of macrophages results in damage in the reticuloendothelial system including the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Gaucher disease has three types (1, 2 and 3), the first type does not have neurological involvement, but the other two forms involve neurological impairment.</span></p>
<p><span>4.Fabry disease is an X-linked disease and is caused by the mutations in GLA. Deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL3) in tissues throughout the body and multi-organ system disease (11).</span></p>
<p><span>Different types of treatments:</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last few decades the pharmaceutical companies have developed several therapies for LSD disorders. Unfortunately, these therapies do not treat the disease, but they only slow down the progression of it.</span></p>
<p><span>The efficacy of these treatments is also quite limited due to the late diagnosis of the condition when the organ damage has already happened. To prevent this from happening, many countries have initiated the screening in newborn infants for these disorders.</span></p>
<p><span>The treatments that are available might be as simple as supportive care or more specific to the condition such as haematopoietic stem cells transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction and chaperone therapy (3).</span></p>
Why pharmaceutical companies invest in orphan diseases?

This category of diseases along with several other rare (orphan diseases) have drawn the attention of many pharmaceutical companies over the last few decades. But why pharmaceutical companies invest in the development of medicines for orphan diseases?

One of the reasons for that is the incentives (marketing exclusivity and many other benefits) given to the pharmaceutical companies by governments to develop treatments for rare conditions (3, 8). In the USA, the US Orphan Drug Act (ODA), introduced in 1983, increased the research on rare diseases and it resulted in more than 450 products for 668 orphan indications to be approved by the FDA in 2017 (8). Likewise, the European Union introduced a similar policy (act) in 2000 fostering the discovery of treatments for orphan diseases.

Another reason is the continuous advancements in biotechnology and especially the emerging gene therapies. Moreover, the characteristics of the rare diseases facilitated the development of treatments for these conditions as most of these conditions have a very specific defined cause. They are monogenic (Mendelian) and that makes them easier to be researched upon.

Lastly, the development of treatments for rare diseases might sound expensive as compared to treatments for common diseases but this is not entirely true. From a clinical trial standpoint, the approval of a medicine for a rare disease is possible to be achieved with only 20 participants whereas the clinical testing of a new medicine for a common cardiovascular disease would require thousands of people (8).

Finally,

The Lysosomal storage diseases are a new field of research which has become quite immense and has drawn the attention of many pharmaceutical companies. The intentions are not always the purest ones as there are many financial motives behind the R&D of these treatments. However, the development of medicines for rare disorders has created a better awareness of these disorders and the new treatments have improved the life of many people that would not be able to survive otherwise.
