<p><u>An overview of Robot-assisted surgery</u></p>
<p>The robot-assisted surgery is a type of surgery performed by using mechanical arms with surgical instruments attached to them as opposed to the traditional surgeries. This permits the doctor to follow MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgical) procedures. The robotic surgery facilitates operations of high precision with quarter-inch incisions made by miniaturised surgical instruments, as compared with the traditional surgery during which the surgeon operates through large incisions (2). Although, the robotic surgery was first introduced in orthopaedics, neurosurgery, and cardiac surgery, it became so popular only after its use in urology and more specifically in prostate surgeries. Nowadays, it is also used in other types of operations such as general surgery, gynaecology, head and neck surgeries (1).</p>
<p><u>The different types of robotic surgery</u></p>
<p>The robotic surgeries can be classified into three main categories based on the control the surgeon has on the robotic system. These are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisory-Controlled Systems are the most automated, but they still need human control to operate. The main disadvantage of this type is that it cannot be adjusted once it is initiated allowing no errors to be made (hip and knee replacement).</li>
<li>Tele Surgical Systems also known as remote surgery during which the doctor moves the surgical arms instead of them working automatically accordingly to a program pre-set.</li>
<li>Shared Control Systems operate by following a program pre-set chosen by the surgeon and they are used mostly in neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery (2).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Advantages and disadvantages</u></p>
<p>The robot-assisted surgery came to become so popular due to the many advantages over the traditional surgery. By using robotic systems, the patient can be operated on in a very precise way with the doctor being able to create small cuts and delicate incisions. There is less blood in the incision, less noticeable marks and the recovery is often quicker than it is in the traditional surgeries. In addition, it provides the surgeon with 3D view, fluid movement, motion scaling and it eliminates the surgeon&rsquo;s tremor and fatigue. As far as the disadvantages are concerned, there is always a risk of infection or other complications with this also being the case in the traditional surgeries. Robotic surgeries also have other limitations such as the lack of haptic information and the high cost (3).</p>
<p><u>The development of Robotic Systems</u></p>
<p>The da Vinci Surgical System was the first robotic surgery system to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 and since then it has been widely used by hospitals across Europe and the USA. The Socrates Robotic Telecollaboration System was used for the first time in 2001 and this system permits the surgeon to communicate with the operative surgeon through the telecommunication system performing a surgery known as telesurgery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sophie (Surgeon's Operating Force-Feedback Interface Eindhoven) is the first surgical robot that has a force-feedback mechanism. This robotic system allows the doctor to have control of the pressure he/ she puts on to the organs. Other systems are the iDrive and the iConsole device which provide the surgeon with extra cutting and stapling options. Finally, the Stealth system combines 3D imaging system with X-ray, CT, MRI and Ultrasound properties (2).</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u></p>
<p>The Robotic Surgery is an automated type of surgery used in a wide variety of operations providing the doctor with different levels of control over the robot. It has become popular due to its many advantages such as the high precision and dexterity but there is a lot of research yet to be done in terms of the long-term outcomes it can have. Lastly, The Robotic surgery is a very promising field with new developments yet to be made.</p>
