<p><span>The current outbreak of COVID-19 got me thinking of what the subject of my new article should be. After giving it a lot of thought, I realised that this article </span>should not<span> be one more article about SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>
<p><span>I do realise that the current situation has affected every single one of us significantly, but novel viruses are not the only threat that governments, healthcare systems and scientists need to address.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, this article is about <strong><em>superbugs</em></strong>!</span></p>
<p><span>The resistance of certain strains of bacteria to multiple antibiotic agents is a real threat that we do not seem to be taking seriously. These bacteria have started becoming unbeatable and this might result in healthcare professionals having no treatment options for even minor bacterial infections in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>The seriousness of superbugs infections can be better understood by looking at the data published by the U.S Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which shows that each year the antibiotic resistant strains infect more than 2 million people and kill at least 23,000 people in the USA (1).</span></p>
<p><span><strong data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">What are the superbugs and which ones are the most common?</strong></span></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, superbugs are strains of bacteria which are resistant to multiple antibiotics and are difficult to treat. They are more likely to occur in a healthcare setting although some of them exist in the community as well. These infections can compromise the patient&rsquo;s health by spreading throughout the body causing systematic infection, severe immune response (sepsis), multiple organ damage and failure (2,3).</p>
<p><span>Some of the most frequently encountered superbugs are being mentioned and described in the following paragraphs.</span></p>
<ol role="group" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Block: List" id="block-81ebfa28-ba35-41a7-be06-cbde4d73e1c4" class="rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected is-hovered" type="1" data-block="81ebfa28-ba35-41a7-be06-cbde4d73e1c4" data-type="core/list" data-title="List" contenteditable="true" tabindex="0">
<li><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) </em><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true"></em><br />Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive coccus that in the microscope looks like a 0.5-1.5-&micro;m balls clumped together. Infections with MRSA can be either hospital associated or community associated.&nbsp; Moreover, the most frequently reported invasive MRSA-related conditions are septic shock, pneumonia, endocarditis, bacteraemia, and cellulitis. (5).
Many penicillin and penicillin like antibiotics used to be effective against S. aureus, but resistance to them has been developed over the years (3). The first epidemics of nosocomial S. aureus resistance to penicillin was reported in 1960s, almost one decade after the prophylactic use of postoperative antibiotics became commonplace (5).</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li><i>Multiple drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i><br />
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium which can be found in the environment and it can be transmitted via contaminated soil or water, but it is also transmissive between people (6). In a hospital setting, P aeruginosa can be contracted by touching contaminated equipment, hands, and surfaces. It can cause skin, ear, or eye infections but patient who are hospitalised or immunocompromised are more susceptible to severe infections such as pulmonary tract infections and blood infections (3).</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li><i>Multiple drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii </i><br />
Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram negative, coccobacillus, obligate aerobe and it is also one of the pathogens for which we urgently need novel antibiotics (4). It is already resistant to the most prescribed antibiotics including carbapenems.
The infection can be acquired either during the hospitalisation of the patient or in the community and it can be one of the following: skin and soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, bacteraemia, meningitis. Infection acquired in the community occurs mainly in areas with humid and hot climate (4). Lastly, this species can survive in the skin and elsewhere in the environment for many days and thus, attention to hygiene practices is crucial (3).</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li><i>E.Coli H30-R</i><br />
Escherichia coli is one of the bacteria that lives normally in the human body as a part of the gut microbiota. However, there are certain strains of it that can cause food poisoning or other that can lead to serious infections. E. coli H30-R is specifically mentioned because it is resistant to fluoroquinolones and can lead to sepsis if it passes from the urinary tract to the blood stream (3).</li>

But which are the already existing antibiotics?


The antibiotic drugs can be classified into different categories based on their mechanism of action. Therefore, some of the most important antibiotics can either interfere with the bacterial cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis or they can inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and bacterial topoisomerase IV. An overview of these antibiotic agents is being given throughout the next few paragraphs.


Cell wall synthesis inhibitors: The cell wall synthesis inhibitors interfere with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall which is a structure not existent in the mammalian cells and thus, these antibiotics can selectively bind to the bacterial cell.

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Penicillins: These antibiotics are b-lactams and are one of the most effective and least toxic antibiotics, but resistance to them has been developed. Penicillins inhibit the last step of the bacterial cell wall synthesis, the so called transpeptidation or cross linkage of the cell wall. They also interfere with the Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which are involved in the cell wall synthesis and the maintenance of the morphologic characteristics of the bacterium. PBPs can gradually change and these alterations result to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Penicillins are categorised into:</li>
<br />
<ul>
<li><em>Natural penicillins</em>: penicillin V and G.</li>
<li><em>Antistaphylococcal penicillins</em>: methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin and dicloxacillin. These medicines are b-lactamase (penicillinase) resistant antibiotics.</li>
<li><em>Extended spectrum penicillins</em>: amoxicillin and ampicillin and are usually co-administered with b-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam to protect them from inactivation by penicillinases.</li>
<li><em>Antipseudomonal penicillins</em>: piperacillin and tircacillin which are usually co-administered with b-lactamase inhibitors such clavulanic acid or tazobactam to extend their antimicrobial spectrum to penicillinase-producing organisms.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>Cephalosporins: Cephalosporins are b-lactam antibiotics and they are structurally and functionally related to penicillins. Cephalosporins tend to be more resistant to b-lactamases.Â  Cephalosporins are classified into first, second, third, fourth and advanced generation.
</li>
<li>
 Carbapenems: Although these antibiotics are b-lactam, they have some structural differences when compared to penicillins. Some examples are imipenem and meropenem.
</li>
<li>Monobactams: are cell wall inhibitors against gram negative bacteria such as Aeruginosa and the only monobactam that is commercially available is aztreonam.
</li>
<li>B-lactamase inhibitors are co-administered with b-lactams and they inhibit penicillinases. Some examples are tazobactam, clavulanic acid, sulbactam (8).
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">Protein synthesis inhibitors</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Tetracyclines: they bind to the 30s ribosome and prevent the binding of t-RNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex and the completion of protein synthesis.
<ol>
<li>Side effects: They tend to form chelates with divalent and trivalent cations and thus, their co-administration with dairy products can reduce their absorption. Other side effects are: gastric discomfort, effects on calcified tissues, sunburn.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Aminoglycosides: their action is concentration dependent and they exert Post Antibiotic Effect. Some examples are neomycin, tobramycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, amikacin. They can cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.<br /><br /></li>
<li>&nbsp;Macrolides: Azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (substitute for penicillin G in case of b-lactam allergy). Erythromycin can upset the stomach whereas azithromycin and clarithromycin are well tolerated (9).</li>
</ol>

<p><span><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">Quinolones: newer generation of antibiotics</em></span></p>
<p><span><!-- wp:paragraph --></span></p>
<p>Quinolones are one of the newest categories of antibiotics. Their mechanism of action is to interfere with the DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV causing DNA strand breakages. There are different generations of quinolones, these are as follows:</p>
<p><span><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --></span></p>
<ul>
<li>First generation: nalidic acid</li>
<li>Second generation: ciprofloxacine and norfloxacin</li>
<li>Third generation: levofloxacin</li>
<li>Fourth generation: moxifloxacin</li>
</ul>
<p><span><!-- /wp:list -->Quinolones can cause phototoxicity and dietary supplements containing zinc or iron or even calcium and other divalent cations can disrupt their absorption. One of their side effects is phototoxicity and thus, the patient should be advised to use sunscreen at the same time. The most common side effects are diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea (10).</span></p>

<p><strong>Newly approved antibiotic agents</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Having already mentioned some of the most common resistant species (superbugs) and the most important antibiotic categories, many of you would wonder whether there are new antibiotic agents available. In response to this question, there are several new antibiotic agents already on the market whereas others are underway. Examples of new antibiotics approved by the FDA in 2019 are the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<ul role="group" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Block: List" id="block-34d72f3d-49f5-43a2-9e48-010c87829adc" class="rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected is-hovered" data-block="34d72f3d-49f5-43a2-9e48-010c87829adc" data-type="core/list" data-title="List" contenteditable="true" tabindex="0">
<li>Fetroja (cefiderocol): b-lactam agent belonging to the category of cephalosporins. This medicine is effective against A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and K. pneumoniae.</li>
<li>Lasvic (lascufloxacin): belongs to the quinolone category and it targets topoisomerase II. It is effective against: S. aureus, K. pneumonia, Enterobacter spp. and possibly A. baumannii.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Xenleta (lefamulin): this agent is a pleuromutilin targeting 50S ribosomal subunit at the peptidyl transferase center. Effective against S. aureus.</li>
<li>Recarbrio (imipenem/ cilastatin + relebactam): this medicine is a combination of a carbapenem, dehydropeptidase inhibitor and b-lactamase inhibitor targeting the PBP and b-lactamase and being effective against <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em> spp (7).</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Is the research of new antibiotics underfunded?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Although there have been new agents either already on the market or at different stages of clinical trials, the research of new antibiotics remains to be rather underfunded. There has been a certain period back in 1980s when many new antibiotics would be approved. Nevertheless, nowadays the world can hardly see one or two new antibiotics entering the market. There are several reasons why this might be happening.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Firstly, antibiotics are medicines meant to be reserved for treatment when it is necessary, otherwise resistance will be developed. Therefore, this fact per se does not offer enough financial incentives for companies to invest in the research of new antibiotics.</p>

<p><span>Moreover, for a new medicine to be approved by the regulatory authorities the clinical trials need to have a big number of participants. This leads to clinical trials being costly for the pharmaceutical companies. To this aim, EMA and FDA have introduced new guidelines to incentivise the research of antibiotics by reducing the number of participants in the clinical trials that is necessary for antibiotics to get approved (11). Lastly, the price of antibiotics is another aspect that should be reassessed to incentivise the research of antibiotics.</span></p>
<p><span>Conclusively&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>Superbugs are an important topic that should be discussed and looked upon by scientists and health authorities. There have already been many efforts to draw the attention of the society to the antimicrobial resistance and the consequences of it for humanity. However, there are many more things to be done starting with incentivising pharmaceutical companies to invest in the research of new antibiotic agents. Lastly, as resistance is something that may continue occurring even if new medicines are developed, educating healthcare professionals and patients on the right use of antibiotics could be of a great significance.</span></p>
