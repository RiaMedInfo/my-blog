<p class="a"><span class="a0"><b><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Acne</span></i></b></span><span class="a0"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></b></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">is a condition that many people struggle with and it has always been an interesting topic to write about as it is relatable to most of us. Having myself suffered with acne for almost one year now, I can understand how unpleasant and overwhelming someone&rsquo;s life can get when having to deal with acne. It can affect the person&rsquo;s self-esteem, confidence, and wellbeing. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">On the other hand, someone could also argue that acne is a condition which the person will have to learn how to live with and oftentimes, can lead to the adoption of a better lifestyle such as healthier diet and better self-care habits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Talking numbers, acne is quite common in teenagers and young adults and 95% of people aged from 11 to 30 years get affected by it to a different extent. Most of the people will also need to deal with acne for many years until the symptoms start subsiding and eventually improve (7). Therefore, why not stop thinking of acne as an <span class="a0"><span style="color: black;">unwelcome guest </span></span>and start trying to understand it, explore all treatment options and improve our lifestyle? </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="a"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Understanding acne-what is acne? <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin and it can result from different factors such as androgen-induced sebum overproduction, inflammation of the hair follicles due to colonisation by the Propionibacterium acnes, a syndrome called polycystic ovary syndrome and possibly the menstrual cycle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Acne can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe and it can result in painful lesions, scarring and eventually low confidence and subsequent conditions such as depression, social isolation, and suicidal ideation (3). Moreover, it usually appears in adolescence, but it can also occur during adulthood. Acne can develop on several parts of the body such as face, back, chest and usually involves one or more of the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Blackheads: small, black, or yellowish bumps on the skin (open plugged pores).</li>
<li>Whiteheads: closed plugged pores.</li>
<li>Papules: small, red bumps.</li>
<li>Pustules: they look like papules, but they also have a white tip in the centre.</li>
<li>Nodules: large hard lumps that develop beneath the surface of the skin.</li>
<li>Cysts: they are the most severe form of acne; they are large lumps filled with pus and they can cause permanent scarring (4, 7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What acne treatment options are available: </strong></p>
<p>The type of acne treatment that someone will receive depends on the severity of the condition and the patient&rsquo;s tolerability. The mild-moderate acne is normally treated with a combination of topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotic creams, topical retinoids, azelaic acid.&nbsp; All the systemic therapies are usually reserved for moderate to severe acne (oral contraceptives, oral antibiotics, oral isotretinoin) (5,6,7). Table 1 displays the most common acne therapies based on the severity of the individual&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are several treatments that do not involve administration of medicines, and these can be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comedone extractor: a sharp instrument used to remove blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
<li>Peeling: using chemicals to peel off the skin.</li>
<li>Light-based therapies: using light to improve acne symptoms (2, 6, 11).</li>
</ul>
<p class="a"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">A little bit more about light therapies</span></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> &hellip;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Light therapies constitute a highly effective alternative to conventional acne treatments, and they cause less side effects than treatment with antibiotics or retinoids. Light-based therapies can be the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Narrowband light sources: blue light (415nm) and red light.</li>
<li>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL).</li>
<li>Lasers: Pulsed dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate laser, Infrared (IR) laser.</li>
<li>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the combination of light and photosensitisers to which the skin is exposed prior to light therapy.</li>
<li>Photopneumatic technology: Negative pressure is applied to the skin so that the sebaceous glands open and sebum, dead skin cells and bacteria are released from the skin (11).</li>
</ul>
<p>The very idea of the light-based therapies derived from the fact that patients experienced acne improvement after exposure to natural light. Research has shown that light can decrease the production of Propionibacterium acne and reduce the size of the pilosebaceous unit.</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>More specifically, porphyrins naturally produced in the sebaceous follicles by P. acne absorb light. This results to porphyrin over-excitation, release of singlet oxygen and reactive free radicals which have a bactericidal effect on P.acne. Red light (longer wavelength than blue light) activates porphyrins less effectively, but it penetrates deeper into the skin. Therapy with Infrared Lasers (IR) or photodynamic therapy affect the sebaceous glands directly leading to reduced size of the glands and sebum production.</p>
<p>Although clinical studies are limited, light-based therapies have been proved to be effective. Blue or blue-red light treatment can have great results in mild to moderate acne. PDT is also highly effective. However, more studies need to be conducted so that the effectiveness of light-based therapies can be better compared to traditional treatments (11).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Improving diet to treat acne: myth or truth?</strong></p>
<p>Although the connection between acne and diet is not clear and has not been scientifically proved, it is rather often stated that diet can improve acne (8). &nbsp;Indeed, someone would expect that a diet rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients would influence acne in a good way.</p>
<p>Exploring the idea of the possible effect of diet on acne, there are nutrients such as Vitamin A and Vitamin D and several minerals (zinc and iron: anti-inflammatory properties) that play a significant role in the bodily function. Moreover, essential fatty acids such as linoleic and a-linolenic acids, precursors to omega-3 and omega-6 acid families, affect inflammation in the body and thus, someone could argue that essential fatty-acids might affect inflammation in acne as well (8).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">On the other hand, products such as dairy can lead to the production of hormones in the sebaceous glands and the over production of sebum. One study has linked the consumption of milk to acne (1). Another dietary factor is the glycaemic index of our diet. According to Smith et al. consumption of food with high glycemic index can lead to overproduction of insulin, raise androgen concentration and lower SHBG (Sex hormone-binding globulin which lowers acne severity) (8,9,10). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="a" style="margin-top: 12.0pt;"><span class="a0"><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Conclusively,</span></i></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> acne is a quite common condition that affects mostly young people, and it can persist for many years. Therefore, being aware of all the available treatment options is extremely important. Moreover, being able to recognise the severity of the condition could be critical for the person to seek medical help at the right time and avoid the progression of acne. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 101%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In this article, diet was also examined as one of the possible ways to improve acne symptoms although this has not been scientifically proved. However, doing some research on the different nutrients and how they can affect our health could be an eye-opener. At the end of the day, getting a healthier diet might not necessarily lead to treating acne but it can be beneficial to someone&rsquo;s health and it can be a great boost to our confidence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
