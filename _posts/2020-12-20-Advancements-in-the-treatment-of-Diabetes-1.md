<p>Diabetes is a group of different conditions caused by relative or absolute insulin deficiency. According to the <strong>American Diabetes Association</strong>, diabetes can be classified into the following clinical syndromes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes 1: absolute insulin deficiency.</li>
<li>Diabetes 2: relative insulin deficiency, also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.</li>
<li>Gestational diabetes.</li>
<li>Diabetes due to other causes such as genetic factors or medication.</li>
</ul>
<p>The treatment depends on the type of Diabetes as well as the severity of the condition. Hence, patients having diabetes 1 rely on the administration of exogenous insulin due to the complete destruction of b-cells in the islets of Langerhans. On the other hand, patients with Diabetes 2 will normally have some levels of insulin and thus, their treatment will be mainly limited to diet improvement, exercise and glucose lowering medicines (10).</p>

<p><strong>Insulin and insulin analogues</strong></p>
<p>Insulin is a polypeptide hormone produced in b-cells of pancreas. Human insulin treatment is produced with recombinant DNA technology by using genetically modified Escherichia coli cells or yeast to contain the gene of human insulin. Hence, insulin products can either be regular insulin (the exact same hormone as the human insulin) or it can be modified to give insulin analogues with different pharmacokinetic properties such as different time of onset and duration.</p>
<p>The existing insulin analogues based on the duration of their action are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Rapid acting and short acting insulin analogues</u>: Regular insulin is a short acting insulin whereas insulin aspart, glulisine and lispro are rapid acting analogues. These insulins are used to control prandial and post prandial levels of glucose and thus, they need to have a very quick onset.</li>
<li><u>Intermediate acting insulin</u> is the NPH (Neutral protamine Hagedorn), it is used as basal (fasting insulin) and it is given along with a short acting insulin.</li>
<li><u>Long-acting insulin</u>: Insulin glargine and insulin detemir. The action of insulin glargine has no peak onset demonstrating a flat prolonged action. These two insulins are used for the basal control of blood glucose levels (10).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some patients might receive <u>combinations of insulins</u> such as 70% NPH and 20% regular insulin to avoid multiple injections per day. The downside of this treatment is that it can limit other aspects of patient&rsquo;s life such as diet and the amount of carbohydrates that can be consumed (5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>New treatments for Diabetes 1</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Loop systems</strong></p>
<p>The loop systems are systems of continuous administration of insulin via a pump. They can be classified into open and closed loop systems.</p>
<p>The <u>open loop systems</u> consist of a pump (subcutaneous insulin pump) and a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). The latter monitors the levels of blood glucose so that the patient knows whether he/ she needs to adjust the insulin released by the pump. The open loop systems are user dependent meaning that the patient needs to alter insulin infusion rates to maintain normal blood glucose levels during eating, stress, activity, fasting (9).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <u>closed loop systems</u> are the next generation of loop systems. They are different to the open loop systems in that they bridge the gap between the pump and the CGM by using an algorithm software. In these systems, the algorithm software translates the information of the CGM into a message that can be read by the pump to release the corresponding amount of insulin (9).</p>
<p>The closed loop systems can be DIY, but as they have not been approved by regulators the final use is at the patient&rsquo;s own risk (1). The regulated alternative to DIY is Medtronic MiniMed&trade;670G. This closed loop system is not an artificial pancreas, but it is a hybrid closed-loop system having two different modes: the manual and the automated (2, 8).</p>
<p>Lastly, although the closed loop systems constitute a significant progress toward more user independent insulin treatments, we are still far from the discovery of an &lsquo;&rsquo;artificial pancreas&rsquo;&rsquo; that can replicate the function of pancreatic b-cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Inhaled insulin</strong></p>
<p>Inhaled insulin technology was first developed by Nektar Therapeutics in 1980 and it was then licensed to Pfizer. The first inhaled insulin to be approved was Exubera in 2006 and the second was Afrezza in 2014 (6, 7) developed by MannKind. These two insulins are rapid-acting insulins and although they were a good alternative for people with needle phobia, they failed. This was partially because of low sales and due to concerns around the safety of inhaled insulin.</p>
<p><strong>Exubera</strong> was withdrawn in 2007 as it was linked to side effects such as increased risk of hypoglycaemia, lung infections, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis. Moreover, there were safety concerns as six patients in clinical studies in the Exubera arm were diagnosed with lung malignancies as compared to the comparator arm (7).</p>
<p><strong>Afrezza</strong> appears to have key advantages over Exubera as its delivery system is more user friendly. In clinical trials, Alfrezza was less effective in lowering HbA1c as compared to multiple injections but the difference was not large. Moreover, Alfrezza was proved to cause less incidents of hypoglycaemia compared to Exubera. Nevertheless, the safety profile of Alfrezza is similar to the one of Exubera as both medicines were shown to slightly increase the lung cancer occurrence and to affect the pulmonary function (3, 7).</p>
<p><strong>Insulin pill</strong></p>
<p>Insulin pills or tablets are meant to administer insulin via the oral route. This pharmaceutical presentation of insulin is still at an early stage of development as insulin is a difficult protein to be given orally. Insulin is broken down in the stomach and the small intestine and therefore, insulin oral presentation still needs additional research to be developed (4).</p>
<p>Diabetes is a condition that is rapidly affecting more and more people worldwide. It is in fact a group of conditions and it can be classified into different syndromes based on the level of insulin deficiency. The patient will be treated according to the severity of the condition. In this article, treatments for diabetes 1 including human insulin and insulin analogues were further discussed. Moreover, new treatments such as insulin loop systems and inhaled insulin were presented. Lastly, inhaled insulin and insulin tablets were also discussed as an alternative for people with needle phobia as it could potentially improve compliance with diabetes treatment.&nbsp;</p>
