<p><u>Definition of depression</u></p>
<p>Depression is a condition which causes difficulty to experience pleasure in everyday activities and it is usually accompanied by loss of energy, as well as changes in sleep pattern and appetite. Depression can manifest itself in two ways: &nbsp;solely depressive episodes (unipolar depression) or both depressive and manic episodes during which the person experiences the opposite symptoms such as extreme enthusiasm, anger, impaired judgement (bipolar disorder) (1), (3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to WHO, depression is encountered in more than 264 million people of all ages worldwide and it is more likely to affect women than men. Depression can be mild, moderate, or severe with the latter very often leading to suicide. As per WHO data, nearly 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. This can be attributed to the fact that not everyone has equal access to diagnosis, support, and medical treatment (low and middle-income countries).</p>
<p><u>Diagnosis:</u></p>
<p>For the diagnosis of depression, five of the following nine <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health, Fourth Edition (</em>DSM-IV) symptoms might be present continuously for a minimum 2-week period:</p>
<ul>
<li>depressed mood</li>
<li>loss of interest or pleasure</li>
<li>significant weight or appetite alteration</li>
<li>insomnia or hyposomnia</li>
<li>psychomotor agitation or retardation</li>
<li>fatigue or loss of energy</li>
<li>feelings of worthlessness</li>
<li>diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness</li>
<li>suicidal ideation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that depression is often difficult to diagnose due to the fine line between pathological behaviour and everyday experience (3).</p>
<p>Moreover, in many countries&rsquo; depression is still associated with social stigma which leads to lack of diagnosis and treatment. Even in countries where there is treatment available, people are often misdiagnosed (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Pathophysiology of depression</u></p>
<p>The scientific explanation behind depression can be found in the biogenic amine theory. More specifically, certain receptors in the brain called reuptake receptors do not function properly leading to deficiency of the neurotransmitters: norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine (3). The same theory suggests that mania is caused by the overproduction of these neurotransmitters. &nbsp;The levels of these neurotransmitters are critical considering their projections into several areas in the brain and their impact on many behavioural aspects, such as mood, vigilance, motivation, fatigue (3).</p>
<p>Therefore, the available medical treatments target these receptors by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine in certain sites in the brain and leading to increased levels of the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft (1). Nevertheless, this theory is quite simplistic, and it fails to explain why although the pharmacological effect on the neurotransmission occurs almost immediately, the therapeutic effect takes longer (1).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Medical treatments</u></p>
<p>Antidepressants are classified into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIS):</u> are very specific to Serotonin transporters; hence, they have extremely limited impact on a-adrenergic, muscarinic, H1 histaminic receptors and in turn, they don&rsquo;t cause the adverse effects of dry mouth, blurred vision, orthostatic hypotension. However, they can cause weight gain and sexual dysfunction. They are used in depression, obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and bulimia nervosa. Some examples from this category are Fluoxetine (PROZAC) and Sertraline (ZOLOFT).</li>
<li><u>Norepinephrine Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</u> (NSRIS) are non-selective treatments which target both norepinephrine and serotonin receptors. Some examples are Venlafaxine (EFFEXOR) and Duloxetine (CYMBALTA).</li>
<li><u>Atypical antidepressants</u>: Some examples are Bupropion (WELLBUTRIN) and Mirtazapine (REMERON). These medicines target different sites in the brain. One of the advantages of these two medications (Bupropion and mirtazapine) is that they do not cause sexual dysfunction unlike SSRIs.</li>
<li><u>TCA (tricyclic antidepressants)</u>: They target both norepinephrine and serotonin receptors and they are more likely to cause adverse events related to the blockage of a-adrenergic, muscarinic, and histaminic receptors (blurred vision, xerostomia (dry mouth), urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension). Some examples are Amitriptyline, Amoxapine, Clomipramine. They are used in moderate to severe depression and they have also been used in migraine and chronic neuropathic pain.</li>
<li><u>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI):</u> They inhibit Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) enzyme which is responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters in the brain. Their use is limited due to dietary restrictions as the patient will have to avoid aged cheeses and meats, chicken liver, pickled or smoked fish, and red wines, which contain tyramine. Tyramine is degraded by MAO and inhibition of this enzyme by the MAOIs can cause accumulation of tyramine and hence, adverse events such as hypertensive crisis. Examples from this category are phenelzine and selegiline (1), (4).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other non-pharmacological ways to increase serotonin levels in the brain are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive mood induction can increase the level of CNS serotonin in the same way serotonin can improve mood. Perreau-Linck and colleagues (6), used positron emission tomography (PET) to assess how positive, neutral, and negative stimuli could affect brain serotonin levels of healthy individuals (5), (6).</li>
<li>Exposure to bright light can significantly increase serotonin levels as bright light is treatment for seasonal depression but it could be a possible treatment for long term depression as well.</li>
<li>Exercise and diet can increase tryptophan (serotonin precursor) levels in the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depression is a condition that cannot be easily diagnosed and treated due to its symptoms being close enough to regular everyday experience but often, due to societal factors and non-accessibility to treatment. As described previously, the severity of depression can vary significantly and thus, the treatment one receives will be different based on their personal needs. There are several medications that can improve depression and they are usually taken for up to two years or in some cases for longer time (7). Lastly, studies have shown that for people with mild forms of depression other non-pharmacological treatments can also be effective.</p>
