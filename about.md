<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a pharmacist currently working as a Medical Information Specialist in a CRO company. I have broad experience in the pharmaceutical industry and this blog is an effort to discuss different medical topics that can be of interest to a diverse audience, healthcare professionals and the general public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MediCoPrism</strong> is aimed to work in the same way as a prism does - give different perspectives&nbsp;<strong><em>different colours of light</em></strong>&nbsp;on a single topic as the prism does with a single beam of white light.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, MediCoPrism is a way for me as a healthcare professional and as a scientist to stay up to date with the most recent developments in healthcare and at the same time to do what I have always been passionate about: writing and researching. </span></p>
